Hi, my name is Jason Grant and this is my Module 1 Challenge.

The HTML had little to no semantic elements. I provided semantic elements and made changes in the CSS file to reflect those changes.


The HTML needed alt image attributes for all images. I provided a description in case the images were unable to load or a screen reader is being used. alt="whatever the picture is supposed to show"

Clicking on the Search Engine Optimization link did nothing, it should have moved the screen to the element containing Search engine optimization. I added id="search-engine-optimization" and now the link works the same as the other 2 links.

The title element stated simply, "Website." I changed the title element to; "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc."

This is not my original work. All source code cme from BCS Module 1 Challenge. I completed this assignment with the help of Google, YouTube, W3 Schools and the wonderful classmates and Ta's we have!
